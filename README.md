## Overview of Project
Using data oof UFO sightings, We are building an HTML page to allow users to sort through the data by inputting their own filters.
## Results
The user is greeted by a banner and a blurb about UFO sightings. The data is presented in full at first. In order to filter the data, the user will have to input terms into the filter boxes provided on the left of the page.

Upon entering filter terms, the site presents only the data that matches the input. Here, we entered a date: 1/1/2010, a city: el cajon, a state: ca, and a country: us.

As you can see, the filtered results showcase all the sightings for the very specific filter terms we requested. 

The filter requests don't have to be so specific, though. The user can input as few as one filter in any of the filter boxes, and all the results that match will be returned. The user can filter by Date, City, State, Country, or Shape.

## Summary
The page works well for what it is, but it does have some limitations. One limitation is that the data being drawn from is from a specific timeframe, which is years ago. The data should be complete-- or updated automatically with every new sighting! Another drawback is that the functionality only includes the ability to filter. Having the filtered data be sortable would improve one's ability to understand the data. A final drawback is that the filter terms need to be exact matches or they don't return anything. Using capital letters, for instance, will not return any data, and that's a massive problem.

So the site works, if you know how to use it, but it could be improved. Either way, the data is interesting, and the site is fun to use.
